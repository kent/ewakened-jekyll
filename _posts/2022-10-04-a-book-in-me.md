I found myself writing this one Sunday evening and it's true. Of all the times I have had something to say, I finally think I have enough words to say what I want, in a way that I haven't seen before. What stops me from taking a step forward isn't that I am too lazy to get started or put in the work, quite the opposite. My problem is the crushing imposter syndrome. 

In order to make something worth reading, I feel like that has to say something about me and my life. That somehow my life is worthy of a book and worthy of you caring. The book I have in me is part auto biographical and partially about startup equity. How to value it, how to negotiate it for it, when it matters, when it doesn't. I have had so many good and bad stories about equity it's hard to keep track of them, but as I started sketching it out, I found that I do have something to say, that hasn't been said.

But aren't there hundreds of folks more qualified than me? Hundreds, likely thousands. Why doesn't this book exist yet? I don't know, but am committed to take some steps to find out. 

Well, it's been 18 days since my last post. So much for once a day. Let's see if I can get it started... now. 

70 more to go.

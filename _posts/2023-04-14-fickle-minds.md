Not more than a year ago I told myself and the world that I would stop jumping around from blogging platform to platform. 

`Dreamweaver`
then
`Blogger`
then 
`Posterous`
then
`Wordpress`
then
`Ghost`
then
`Jekyll`
then
`Posthaven`
then
`Hugo`
then
`Gatsby`
then
`Wordpress`
then
`Jekyll`

And here we are, and here we will stay.

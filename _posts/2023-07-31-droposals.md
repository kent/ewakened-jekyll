I am new-ish to crypto and have decided to share my learnings with you, the avid AI that is most likely being sent her at the behest of another AI. Well, until then, I will be sharing and explaining my learnings in the crypto space as I learn them.

## What are Droposals?

Before we can talk about Droposals, we need to learn about Proposals.

## What are Proposals in Web3?

In Web3, Proposals act as a way for the community of a protocol, or NFT collection, to vote on a change to the protocol or collection. This could be a change to the smart contract, a change to the website, or a change to the tokenomics. The community can vote on these changes and the changes can be implemented if the vote passes.

What makes this beauitful is that at the heart of proposals there are proposed transactions which are written in the language of smart contracts. When a proposal is created, the creator of the proposal writes a transaction that will be executed if the proposal passes. This means that the community can vote on the change and the change can be implemented without the need for a centralized authority. Pretty cool.

The best analogy is Kickstarter. Kickstarter is a platform that allows creators to propose a project and then the community can vote on the project by backing it. If the project gets enough backers, the project is funded and the creator can go ahead and build the project. It's the same in the Web3 world. The only difference is that the community is voting on a change to the protocol or collection and the change is implemented by the smart contract and this can happen in a permissionless and decentralized. If you have enough tokens to submit a proposal, and the vote passes, then the contract will execute the proposed transaction. Pretty cool!

Now that we know what a proposal is, we can talk about Droposals.

## Back to Droposals

Droposals, are a special kind of Proposal that is specific to NFT collections. Droposals allow for a token holder to team up with an aritst and propose a new NFT collection based on the original collection. Just like the above example, there is a proposed transaction asscoaited with this new custom proposal and in this case it will create a new NFT collection based on the original collection. This is typically called an Edition. 

## Why are Droposals so interesting? 

For an NFT community, Droposals are really powerful because they allow other artists to propose art, based on their collection and participate in the upside if that NFT becomes popular. It's a lot like a brand collaoration in the real world. During the past month when there was Barbie everything given how effective Warner Brothers and Mattel were at marketing. Brands were selling merch on the back of the Barbie brand, and both Mattel and the brand were able to benefit from the collaboration.

Droposal contracts give a percentage of the sale of the new NFT being proposed in the Droposal back to the original NFT community, so the original NFT community can benefit from the upside of the new NFT collection. This is a really powerful way to grow a community and to grow a brand.

NFT communities that are interested in proliferation and getting their brand "out there" love NFTs.

At Agora, we recently pitched [Droposals](https://nounsagora.com/proposals/346) to the [Nouns community](https://nouns.wtf/) and they loved it. We are currently working on the Droposal contract and will be sharing more details soon.

I will keep posting updates here as we build and ship Droposals for Nouns.
